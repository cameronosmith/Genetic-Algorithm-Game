# Genetic-Algorithm-Game
a simple game i made to test with a genetic algorithm neural network application.
the game is not complex and is just a ball trying to avoid obstacles to get into a goal.
the net and genetic algorithm are pretty good but the inputs i provided it could be better
to complete more complex obstacles.
